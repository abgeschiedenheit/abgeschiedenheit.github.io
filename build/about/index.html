<p>What seems paradoxical about everything that is justly called beautiful is the fact that it appears. [And everything that appears, by nature, passes away.] In its spatial but also in its temporal totality, the rhythm of Messianic nature is happiness [and happiness is not being in time, but being in the present]. For nature is Messianic by reason of its eternal and total passing away.</p>
<p>– Walter Benjamin</p>
<p>What is Good is Divine too. That, strangely enough, sums up my ethics.</p>
<p>– Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
<p>Love is a divine thing. If it enters a human 
heart, it breaks it. The human heart was created in order to be broken in this way. It is the 
saddest waste if it is broken by anything else. But it prefers to be broken by anything 
rather than by the divine love. Because the divine love breaks only those hearts which 
consent to be broken; and this consent is difficult to give.</p>
<p>– Simone Weil</p>
<p>your life afraid and huge and ripening,</p>
<p>– Rainer Maria Rilke</p>
