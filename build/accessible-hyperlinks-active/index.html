<h1>accessible hyperlinks: :active</h1>
<p>2023-10-21</p>
<p>To do accessibility on the web justice, it isn't enough having hyperlinks solely differentiated by their default styling provided by a browser's user agent stylesheet. I have been indifferent and susceptible to not doing this for a long time but over the years, I've noticed this on a fair share of websites and I thought it was accessibly neat.</p>
<p>What I'm talking about is this behavior you typically see in a <code>form</code> input: an outline when you focus-in on the field. We may just as well fully adopt it for anchor elements.</p>
<p>What we'll need is the <code>:active</code> pseudo-class:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <code>:active</code> CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the <code>outline</code> CSS property:</p>
<blockquote><p>Outline is a line outside of the element's border. Unlike other areas of the box, outlines don't take up space, so they don't affect the layout of the document in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the standard for hyperlinks around the web should have something like this (as used on this site):</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">a:active {
  outline: 1px solid;
}
</code></pre>
