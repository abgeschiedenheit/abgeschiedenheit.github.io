<h1>interaction-heavy, information-weak</h1>
<p>2023-12-11</p>
<p>What makes accessibility difficult is the thin-line it operates in so as not to fall under this all too common software curse of being interaction-heavy but information-weak. The high degree of criticality in accessibility often means the user's intention lies outside interactivity. As for the rest, interaction must be enjoyable and educational lest our design fails in the domain of information software.</p>
