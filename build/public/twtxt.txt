2024-07-04T22:33:48-07:00	Hello!
2024-07-04T22:36:55-07:00	This twtxt microblogging service is rather neat. Thank you to GitHub user 'buckket'.
2024-07-04T22:43:39-07:00	Yesterday night, I saw Whit Stillman's _Metropolitan_ (1990) and oddly enjoyed it. I might have to check out some other films by him.
2024-07-04T22:48:37-07:00	Completely different compared to the previous two films I watched: Bergman's _The Seventh Seal_ (1958) and Wenders' _Wings of Desire_ (1988).
2024-07-04T22:51:26-07:00	Tonight, I'm thinking of watching James Ivory's _A Room with a View_ (1985).
2024-07-04T22:59:04-07:00	Yes, I have resubscribed to the Criterion Channel. It is summer, after all. And the comfortable nights are for open windows and  stories foreign to my own.
2024-07-04T23:05:44-07:00	I already have a fair share of films in 'My list' to watch. Amongst some summer-feeling pictures, I am looking forward to the documentaries about Bob Dylan and Ryuichi Sakamoto.
2024-07-04T23:21:14-07:00	I discovered an English artist by the name of Bridget Riley this past week. I like her work. The first artwork that I saw from hers that led me to research her further: _To a Summer's Day_. Seemingly a small painting series.
2024-07-04T23:40:57-07:00	This book entitled _Carnal Hermeneutics_ is a treat. I am glad and not surprised to see a brief mention of Roland Barthes and his book _The Pleasures of the Text_. Barthes' essay entitled "Listening" would have been fitting for the book.
2024-07-04T23:45:24-07:00	One of Rilke's poems might have also been fitting. The one which starts with: Plump apple, smooth banana, melon, peach, gooseberry... how all this affluence speaks life and death into the mouth.
2024-07-05T01:12:55-07:00	Speaking: the ultimate affirmation of hope.
2024-07-05T01:33:38-07:00	"The moment we speak, we (unconsciously, at least) believe in Godâ€”it is here that we encounter Lacan's 'theological materialism' at its purest: it is speech (ours, ultimately) which creates God" (Zizek).
2024-07-05T01:38:08-07:00	"Even to oppose or challenge the other, you must say 'at least I speak to you,' 'I say yes to our being in common together.' So this is what I meant by love, this reaffirmation of the affirmation" (Derrida).
2024-07-05T03:39:43-07:00	Just finished _A Room with a View_. It was lovely.
2024-07-05T03:50:04-07:00	I have a cut inside my mouth in the upper right, below my lip and it has been displeasing to eat and sleep with these past two days. Reason being: I went for a loose ball in a game of pick-up basketball. I have a scab on my elbow and on my knee. The former was from the same incident. The latter from another loose ball I went for. This all happened last weekend, in seperate days. Appropriate given the season.
2024-07-05T03:59:46-07:00	I'm thinking of making this microblog into it's own repository and set it up with GitHub Pages. That is, I will embed this microblog text (.txt) file in an HTML iframe element. Something to think about.
2024-07-05T04:04:07-07:00	John Cale's new album _POPtical Illusion_ that was released last month is impressive. He is 82. Apparently, it was written over the pandemic.
2024-07-05T04:08:16-07:00	On the topic of music, Meg Baird's _Furling_ released last year has grown to be a favorite of mine. I wished I had known about it earlier in order to have seen her play at a gig she apparently did Long Beach. Some tender stuff.
2024-07-05T04:15:53-07:00	A lapis lazuli twilight.
2024-07-06T16:03:45-07:00	One of the ways I find new music is through Boomkat's Bestsellers list with the default filter of Last 7 Days.
2024-07-06T16:07:45-07:00	Just came across a nice track entitled "Consciousness" by Windy & Carl.
2024-07-06T16:13:57-07:00	One of the lesser-known mystics goes by the name of Hadewijch. Her complete works by Paulist Press is worth reading.
2024-07-06T21:36:52-07:00	Wittgenstein: Think of the following question: Can one imagine a pain, with, say, the quality of rheumatic pain, but _without_ locality? Can one imagine it? When you begin to think this over, you see how much you would like to change the knowledge of the place of pain into a characteristic of what is _felt_, into a characteristic of the sense-datum, of the private object that is there before my mind.
2024-07-06T22:02:16-07:00	Cowardice has no place in summer.
2024-07-07T02:54:10-07:00	Hegel: Education is the art of making people ethical. It considers them as natural beings and shows them the way to a second birth, the way to change their original nature into a second, spiritual nature, and makes this spiritual level habitual to them.
