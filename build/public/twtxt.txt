2024-07-04T22:43:39-07:00	Yesterday night, I saw Whit Stillman's _Metropolitan_ (1990) and oddly enjoyed it. I might have to check out some other films by him.
2024-07-04T22:48:37-07:00	Completely different compared to the previous two films I watched: Bergman's _The Seventh Seal_ (1958) and Wenders' _Wings of Desire_ (1988).
2024-07-04T22:51:26-07:00	Tonight, I'm thinking of watching James Ivory's _A Room with a View_ (1985).
2024-07-04T22:59:04-07:00	Yes, I have resubscribed to the Criterion Channel. It is summer, after all. And the comfortable nights are for open windows and  stories foreign to my own.
