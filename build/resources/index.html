Our editorial practice revolves around building a politically and artistically supported typographic universe, collaborating with diverse and engaged authors. Together, we give life to fonts and graphical objects under open licenses, allowing for their use, modification, and redistribution. Additionally, we explore unconventional paths, fostering transparency and inclusivity to make typeface creation more open and dynamic.</p>
