<h1>the cost of modern web development</h1>
<p>2023-10-17</p>
<p>The other night, I was uninstalling unnecessary packages I had installed with <code>brew</code> and realized there were far too many to account for. Instead of going through each package in <code>brew list</code> and looking up its respective purpose, I decided to purge the entire formulae:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">brew remove --force $(brew list --formula)
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, I came to the realization I was using a no longer supported version of macOS and as such, no longer supported by Homebrew. The consequence? Installing <code>node</code> via <code>brew</code> took rather long given it had to run the <code>node</code> <code>make</code> file, if I'm correct.</p>
<p>But otherwise, reinstalling the necessary packages, I was not surprised to infer the large memory cost of modern web development, i.e., Node.js-based development:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>brew install node</code> requires ~58MB.</li>
<li><code>node</code>'s dependencies account for another ~242MB.</li>
<li>Furthermore, take into account, for a given project, the <code>node_modules</code> folder and all the <code>&quot;dependencies&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;devDependencies&quot;</code>, and their dependencies, ad infinitum.</li>
<li>Regardless of the latter ending up in a <code>.gitignore</code>, the memory requirements of modern web development is seemingly complex.</li>
</ul>
