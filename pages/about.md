Every word was once a poem. Every new relation is a new word. (Ralph Waldo Emerson)

What is Good is Divine too. That, strangely enough, sums up my ethics. (Ludwig Wittgenstein)

Love is a divine thing. If it enters a human heart, it breaks it. The human heart was created in order to be broken in this way. It is the saddest waste if it is broken by anything else. But it prefers to be broken by anything rather than by the divine love. Because the divine love breaks only those hearts which consent to be broken; and this consent is difficult to give. (Simone Weil)
