# resources

A list of tools and services I'm fond of.

## software

- [Validators and tools](https://www.w3.org/developers/tools/)
> Lead your code to its full potential with great and open source tools.

## typography

- [Velvetyne](https://velvetyne.fr)
> Velvetyne is an association and collective dedicated to researching and disseminating typography and typeface creation. Our efforts manifest through collective creation workshops, public engagements, and the promotion of open, playful tools that embrace an uninhibited approach to typography. Our editorial practice revolves around building a politically and artistically supported typographic universe, collaborating with diverse and engaged authors. Together, we give life to fonts and graphical objects under open licenses, allowing for their use, modification, and redistribution. Additionally, we explore unconventional paths, fostering transparency and inclusivity to make typeface creation more open and dynamic.

## accessibility
