2024-07-04T22:33:48-07:00	Hello!
2024-07-04T22:36:55-07:00	This twtxt microblogging service is rather neat. Thank you to GitHub user 'buckket'.
2024-07-04T22:43:39-07:00	Yesterday night, I saw Whit Stillman's _Metropolitan_ (1990) and oddly enjoyed it. I might have to check out some other films by him.
2024-07-04T22:48:37-07:00	Completely different compared to the previous two films I watched: Bergman's _The Seventh Seal_ (1958) and Wenders' _Wings of Desire_ (1988).
2024-07-04T22:51:26-07:00	Tonight, I'm thinking of watching James Ivory's _A Room with a View_ (1985).
2024-07-04T22:59:04-07:00	Yes, I have resubscribed to the Criterion Channel. It is summer, after all. And the comfortable nights are for open windows and  stories foreign to my own.
2024-07-04T23:05:44-07:00	I already have a fair share of films in 'My list' to watch. Amongst some summer-feeling pictures, I am looking forward to the documentaries about Bob Dylan and Ryuichi Sakamoto.
2024-07-04T23:21:14-07:00	I discovered an English artist by the name of Bridget Riley this past week. I like her work. The first artwork that I saw from hers that led me to research her further: _To a Summer's Day_. Seemingly a small painting series.
2024-07-04T23:40:57-07:00	This book entitled _Carnal Hermeneutics_ is a treat. I am glad and not surprised to see a brief mention of Roland Barthes and his book _The Pleasures of the Text_. Barthes' essay entitled "Listening" would have been fitting for the book.
2024-07-04T23:45:24-07:00	One of Rilke's poems might have also been fitting. The one which starts with: Plump apple, smooth banana, melon, peach, gooseberry... how all this affluence speaks life and death into the mouth.
2024-07-05T01:12:55-07:00	Speaking: the ultimate affirmation of hope.
2024-07-05T01:33:38-07:00	"The moment we speak, we (unconsciously, at least) believe in Godâ€”it is here that we encounter Lacan's 'theological materialism' at its purest: it is speech (ours, ultimately) which creates God" (Zizek).
2024-07-05T01:38:08-07:00	"Even to oppose or challenge the other, you must say 'at least I speak to you,' 'I say yes to our being in common together.' So this is what I meant by love, this reaffirmation of the affirmation" (Derrida).
2024-07-05T03:39:43-07:00	Just finished _A Room with a View_. It was lovely.
2024-07-05T03:50:04-07:00	I have a cut inside my mouth in the upper right, below my lip and it has been displeasing to eat and sleep with these past two days. Reason being: I went for a loose ball in a game of pick-up basketball. I have a scab on my elbow and on my knee. The former was from the same incident. The latter from another loose ball I went for. This all happened last weekend, in seperate days. Appropriate given the season.
2024-07-05T03:59:46-07:00	I'm thinking of making this microblog into it's own repository and set it up with GitHub Pages. That is, I will embed this microblog text (.txt) file in an HTML iframe element. Something to think about.
2024-07-05T04:04:07-07:00	John Cale's new album _POPtical Illusion_ that was released last month is impressive. He is 82. Apparently, it was written over the pandemic.
2024-07-05T04:08:16-07:00	On the topic of music, Meg Baird's _Furling_ released last year has grown to be a favorite of mine. I wished I had known about it earlier in order to have seen her play at a gig she apparently did Long Beach. Some tender stuff.
2024-07-05T04:15:53-07:00	A lapis lazuli twilight.
2024-07-06T16:03:45-07:00	One of the ways I find new music is through Boomkat's Bestsellers list with the default filter of Last 7 Days.
2024-07-06T16:07:45-07:00	Just came across a nice track entitled "Consciousness" by Windy & Carl.
2024-07-06T16:13:57-07:00	One of the lesser-known mystics goes by the name of Hadewijch. Her complete works by Paulist Press is worth reading.
2024-07-06T21:36:52-07:00	Wittgenstein: Think of the following question: Can one imagine a pain, with, say, the quality of rheumatic pain, but _without_ locality? Can one imagine it? When you begin to think this over, you see how much you would like to change the knowledge of the place of pain into a characteristic of what is _felt_, into a characteristic of the sense-datum, of the private object that is there before my mind.
2024-07-06T22:02:16-07:00	Cowardice has no place in summer.
2024-07-07T02:54:10-07:00	Hegel: Education is the art of making people ethical. It considers them as natural beings and shows them the way to a second birth, the way to change their original nature into a second, spiritual nature, and makes this spiritual level habitual to them.
2024-07-07T22:10:18-07:00	I would like to organize my books folder containing ~4500 files \(~50GB\), mostly PDFs, with some EPUBs. I've tried writing a Python script to organize them by extracting the metadata from the PDFs but the metadata is either wrong or missing. I'm not suprised that is so. Most of the files come from Anna's Archive.
2024-07-07T22:56:41-07:00	A library that will read the entire content of the PDF and extract the data I want doesn't sound optimal.
2024-07-08T03:44:27-07:00	Just finished _Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me_. Quite good. Strange. I might have to watch the TV show one day.
2024-07-08T04:11:02-07:00	The Julee Cruise track in the film was great. I have never listened to her work, other than her famous track, of course.
2024-07-08T04:13:06-07:00	Came across a short excerpt from a book titled _Of Silence and Song_ by a writer named Dan Beachy-Quick. Found an EPUB of the book on Anna's Archive. Looks good.
2024-07-09T04:55:39-07:00	Kafka: Only if I can raise the world into the Pure, the True, the Immutable.
2024-07-09T04:59:08-07:00	Holderlin: Sometimes this genius goes dark and sinks down into the bitter well of his heart but mostly his apocalyptic star glitters wondrously.
2024-07-09T18:28:35-07:00	There are countless of books I can't find on Anna's Archive. Today's? _Transparent God_ by Claude Esteban.
